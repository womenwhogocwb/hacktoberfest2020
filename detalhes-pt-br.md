## Começando com o Hacktoberfest
## Getting started with Hacktoberfest

Nós recomendamos à todos os participantes que leiam todos os detalhes para garantir que a comunidade global esteja trabalhando em direção à um objetivo em comum. Obrigada por honrar os valores e seguir as regras de participação.

We ask all participants to read through the details to ensure that the global community is working toward a shared goal. Thank you for honoring the values and following the rules of participation.

## Participation details

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate.
- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects. As long as the project is public and GitHub-hosted, your pull requests will count toward your participation.
- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

## Participation rules

To get a shirt, you must make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1–31 in any time zone. Pull requests can be to any public repository on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

## Quality standards

In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), we have provided examples of pull requests that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

- Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix typos/optimize images).
- Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request).
- Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
- Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.
Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.

## Let's work together to reduce spam

- Spammy pull requests can be labeled as "invalid." Maintainers are faced with the majority of spam that occurs during Hacktoberfest, and we dislike spam just as much as you. If you're a maintainer, please label any spammy pull requests submitted to the repositories you maintain as invalid, and close them. Pull requests with this label won't count toward Hacktoberfest.
- There's a seven-day review window for all pull requests before they count toward completing the challenge. Once a participant has submitted four eligible pull requests (ready-to-review, not drafts), the review window begins. This period gives maintainers time to identify and label spammy pull requests as invalid. If the pull requests are not marked as invalid within that window, they will allow the user to complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. If any of the pull requests are labeled as invalid, the user will return to the pending state until they have four eligible pull requests, at which point the review period will start again.
- Bad repositories will be excluded. In the past, we've seen many repositories that encourage participants to make simple pull requests – such as adding their name to a file – to quickly gain a pull request toward completing Hacktoberfest. While this may be a learning tool for new contributors, it goes against one of our core values for Hacktoberfest. The quality of pull requests is paramount; quantity comes second. These repositories do not encourage quality contributions and provide an unfair advantage in completing the Hacktoberfest challenge. We've implemented a system to block these repositories, and any pull requests submitted to such repositories will not be counted.
